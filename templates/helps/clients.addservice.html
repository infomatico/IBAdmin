<h4>New Cluster Service Backup Client</h4>
<p>Here you can define a new cluster service backup client. Cluster service backup client is always associated with
    a cluster service floating IP address. All Cluster Node clients and Cluster Service clients of the same cluster name
    share some of its properties. To define a new cluster service backup client you have to input its name which should
    be unique in the system (you will get an error if it is not), description (optional), address which could be an IP
    or DNS name associated with the cluster service (if application cannot resolve DNS name you cannot add this client)
    and select an existing cluster name from the list and its department. Then optionally check for creating a default
    backup Job for this client.</p>
